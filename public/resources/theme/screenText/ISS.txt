Now travelling to the International Space Station!!!

That's it Commander! You've literally sorted out every mess on Earth! One challenge still remains though, but it's a pretty long journey up there. 

The ISS has a bit of a spacesuit problem, and they need you to patch things up. Now, this is our last mission, so I just wanted to say, it's been a pleasure working with you Commander. Well done on seeing this through!

Now just remember, yellow left, blue right, and try to avoid sorting anything the sensors say is not airtight!
