Now travelling to Tokyo Central!

Harper here again, welcome to my town!
You've done such a good job putting the world back in order, but I was just wondering if I could ask you for a favour? Since the whole world fell into crisis I've had to leave my poor cats at home all on their own, and they're starving! 

...thing is, they only eat food that matches their colour, so...

Just remember, yellow left, blue right, and try to avoid sorting anything the sensors say is inedible!
