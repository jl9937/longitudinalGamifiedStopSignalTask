Now travelling to Packville Factory!

Hello Commander, I'm Harper. I've been assigned to you while we get things back under control.

So, without further ado let's get started. The fruit in Packville Factory have gotten completely out of control, you'll need to get in there and box them up.

Just remember, yellow left, blue right, and try to avoid sorting anything the sensors say is mouldy!
