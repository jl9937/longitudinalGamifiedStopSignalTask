Now travelling to the Great British Docks!

Harper here again. Good job in Paris Commander, you really straightened things out over there. But the job has only just begun.

The situation at the docks is a shambles. We need your help to get things back in tip-top shape again.

Just remember, yellow left, blue right and try to avoid sorting anything the sensors say is broken!!
