Now travelling to Hawaii Beach!

Finally, a somewhere I can get a tan! You've earned a break Commander, it's time to kick back and have a drink in the sun. Too bad that all the cocktail umbrellas are in a muddle! Good thing you're such a sorting expert eh? 

Ok, sort first, drinks after? Let's go!

Just remember, yellow left, blue right, and try to avoid sorting anything the sensors say is broken! You don't wanna serve a cocktail full of splinters.
