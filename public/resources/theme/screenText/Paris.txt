Now travelling to Paris!

This isn't a holiday Commander, Paris is a mess right now! Given your sterling performance over in Packville, we have great confidence that you can help the French get back on their feet. 

Umm, and Commander? I don't suppose you could get me a couple of good bottles of wine while you're over there?

Just remember, yellow left, blue right and try to avoid sorting anything the sensors say is mouldy!
